Why:

	Stakeholders:
	
	- Contact Energy Ltd. (CEL)
	
	Interested in minimising costs and maximising returns. It can be assumed that they will push for the cheapest solution available for them, with the environmental 
	impact of said solution unknown. If the proposed restrictions deem the project unprofitable then they may cancel, resulting in no benefits for all parties.
	
	- Waikato Regioinal Council (WRC)
	
	Interested in appeasing all parties and increasing the quality of life for the region, they are more likely to approve as the benefits to the community increase
	and the detriments to the environment decrease. However, as their positions are subject to the opinions of the public, they may change their decision depending on
	media coverage and public perception.

	- Ngati Tahu (NT)
	
	Local Iwi, interested in maintaining the environmental balance/ ecocentric.
	The current proposal will be vetoed by them due to the issue of groundwater contamination, although this will be necessitated by environmental law as well.

	Outcomes:

	It seems that the most likely outcome is one which meets the minimum environmental regulations, as at the time of the brief the only opposing party is NT.
	However, this may be subject to change depending on changing public opinions during the approval process and the results of the modelling request.


How:

	A computer model may allow the involved parties to measure the following:
	
	- The efficacy of the proposal with regard to the increase in power production.
	- The sustainability of the practice (overall CO2 change in atmospheric and carbonate concentrations)
	- The plausibility of further/increasing CO2 leaks into the groundwater and the veracity of the claims made by CEL and NT
	- The implications for the existing infrastructure

Given:
