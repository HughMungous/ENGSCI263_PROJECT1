# ENGSCI 263: Project 2 - Carbon sequestration

This repository contains the code used for generating the results relevant to our model of carbon sequestration at the Ohaaki reservoir.

## Generating the figures

Simply run the nicer_code.py script to generate the relevant figures. Information about confidence intervals and prediction statistics will be printed to the console if one desires to use them.

```bash
./nicer_code.py
